Touch typing with all ten fingers is a valuable skill with significant importance in today's digital age. Here are some of the key reasons why touch typing is important and significant:

1. Speed and Efficiency: Touch typists can type significantly faster than those who hunt and peck or use only a few fingers. This speed is crucial for productivity, especially in professions where data entry or typing is a significant part of the job.

2. Accuracy: Touch typing promotes accuracy. When you don't have to look at the keyboard, you're less likely to make typing errors. This is particularly important in fields where accuracy is critical, such as medical transcription or coding.

3. Reduced Strain: Touch typing involves using all ten fingers, which means you can distribute the typing workload more evenly. This can reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) like carpal tunnel syndrome, which can result from typing with just a few fingers.

4. Improved Focus: Touch typists can concentrate better on the content they are typing because they don't need to constantly glance at the keyboard. This improved focus can lead to better writing and fewer distractions.

5. Professionalism: Touch typing is often seen as a professional skill. It can enhance your image in the workplace and make you more competitive in the job market.

6. Adaptability: Once you learn touch typing, you can use any standard keyboard without any difficulty. This makes you more adaptable and capable of using various computer systems.

7. Time Savings: Touch typing saves time, both in professional and personal tasks. Whether you're drafting emails, writing reports, or simply chatting with friends, being able to type quickly and accurately can save you a lot of time over the long run.

8. Accessibility: Touch typing can be especially beneficial for individuals with disabilities. It allows them to interact with computers and communicate more efficiently.

9. Lifelong Skill: Once you learn touch typing, it's a skill you can carry with you for life. It's not tied to specific software or hardware, making it a valuable asset as technology evolves.

10. Competitive Advantage: In many job markets, touch typing is considered a standard skill. Having it on your resume can give you a competitive advantage when applying for jobs.
