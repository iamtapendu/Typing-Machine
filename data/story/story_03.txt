9. The Brave Little Dragon
In a mystical land, there lived a tiny dragon named Drake. Unlike other dragons, Drake was small, and his wings were not as strong. But what he lacked in size, he made up for in bravery.

One day, a ferocious storm descended upon the dragon's village, and a great flood threatened to wash away their homes. The older dragons tried to protect their village, but the raging waters were too much for them to handle.

Drake, with his small but determined heart, decided to help. He gathered all the villagers and instructed them to tie ropes around themselves, forming a chain. Then, he flew into the storm, using his fire breath to light the way.

With great effort, Drake guided his fellow dragons and villagers to safety. They climbed to a high mountain, where they watched the storm pass. Everyone was safe, thanks to the bravery of the little dragon.

The village praised Drake for his courage and realized that bravery could come in the smallest of packages. From that day forward, Drake was known as the bravest dragon in the land, and he continued to protect his village with unwavering courage.
